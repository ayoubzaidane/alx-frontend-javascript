# JavaScript Promises and Async/Await

## Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive explanation of JavaScript Promises, including how and why they are used, the methods associated with them, and the `async/await` syntax. By the end of this guide, you should be able to explain these concepts to anyone without the need for external resources.

## Promises

### What is a Promise?

A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It allows you to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous fashion, making your code easier to read and maintain.

### Why Use Promises?

Promises help manage asynchronous operations, allowing you to handle success and error cases effectively. They prevent "callback hell" and make it easier to handle multiple asynchronous operations.

### How to Use Promises

#### Creating a Promise

A Promise is created using the `Promise` constructor, which takes a function with two parameters: `resolve` and `reject`.

```javascript
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Asynchronous operation
  if (/* success */) {
    resolve('Success!');
  } else {
    reject('Error!');
  }
});
